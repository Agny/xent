This is a server-side part of a multiplayer game, which mechanics (by design) resembles one in MMO strategies like Destiny Sphere, Travian, Settlers Online etc.
The very idea behind this project is to test out and look, how good a functional programming in the game development is. 

Work is still in progress and will be in that state for atleast several years - too many features I'm thinking of and too much laziness in implementing them.

The next features are more or less complete at this moment:

- items system
- resources handling
- units movement
- battle calculation
- building mechanics
